[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Data::Peek started off as "DDumper" being a wrapper module over
       Data::Dumper, but grew out to be a set of low-level data introspection
       utilities that no other module provided yet, using the lowest level of
       the perl internals API as possible.

   [1mDDumper ($var, ...)[0m
       Not liking the default output of Data::Dumper, and always feeling the
       need to set "$Data::Dumper::Sortkeys = 1;", and not liking any of the
       default layouts, this function is just a wrapper around
       Data::Dumper::Dumper with everything set as I like it.

           $Data::Dumper::Sortkeys = 1;
           $Data::Dumper::Indent   = 1;

       If "Data::Peek" is "use"d with import argument ":tidy", the result is
       formatted according to Perl::Tidy, see DTidy below, otherwise the
       result is further beautified to meet my needs:

         * quotation of hash keys has been removed (with the disadvantage
           that the output might not be parseable again).
         * arrows for hashes are aligned at 16 (longer keys don't align)
         * closing braces and brackets are now correctly aligned

       In void context, "DDumper" "warn"'s.

       Example

         $ perl -MDP \
           -e'DDumper { ape => 1, foo => "egg", bar => [ 2, "baz", undef ]};'

         {   ape              => 1,
             bar              => [
                 2,
                 'baz',
                 undef
                 ],
             foo              => 'egg'
             };

   [1mDTidy ($var, ...)[0m
       "DTidy" is an alternative to "DDumper", where the output of "DDumper"
       is formatted using "Perl::Tidy" (if available) according to your
       ".perltidyrc" instead of the default behavior, maybe somewhat like
       (YMMV):

         $ perl -MDP=:tidy \
           -we'DDumper { ape => 1, foo => "egg", bar => [ 2, "baz", undef ]};'
         {   'ape' => 1,
             'bar' => [2, 'baz', undef],
             'foo' => 'egg'
             }

       If "Data::Peek" is "use"d with import argument ":tidy", this is the
       default output method for "DDumper".

       If Perl::Tidy is not available, "DTidy" will fallback to "DDumper".

       This idea was shamelessly copied from John McNamara's
       Data::Dumper::Perltidy.

   [1mDDsort ( 0 | 1 | R | N | NR | V | VR | VN | VNR )[0m
       Set the hash sort algorithm for DDumper. The default is to sort by key
       value.

         0   - Do not sort
         1   - Sort by key
         R   - Reverse sort by key
         N   - Sort by key numerical
         NR  - Sort by key numerical descending
         V   - Sort by value
         VR  - Reverse sort by value
         VN  - Sort by value numerical
         VNR - Reverse sort by value numerical

       These can also be passed to import:

         $ perl -MDP=VNR \
           -we'DDumper { foo => 1, bar => 2, zap => 3, gum => 13 }'
         {   gum              => 13,
             zap              => 3,
             bar              => 2,
             foo              => 1
             };
         $ perl -MDP=V \
           -we'DDumper { foo => 1, bar => 2, zap => 3, gum => 13 }'
         {   foo              => 1,
             gum              => 13,
             bar              => 2,
             zap              => 3
             };

   [1mDPeek[0m
   [1mDPeek ($var)[0m
       Playing with "sv_dump", I found "Perl_sv_peek", and it might be very
       useful for simple checks. If $var is omitted, uses $_.

       Example

         print DPeek "abc\x{0a}de\x{20ac}fg";

         PV("abc\nde\342\202\254fg"\0) [UTF8 "abc\nde\x{20ac}fg"]

       In void context, "DPeek" prints to "STDERR" plus a newline.

   [1mDDisplay[0m
   [1mDDisplay ($var)[0m
       Show the PV content of a scalar the way perl debugging would have done.
       UTF-8 detection is on, so this is effectively the same as returning the
       first part the "DPeek" returns for non-UTF8 PV's or the second part for
       UTF-8 PV's. "DDisplay" returns the empty string for scalars that no
       have a valid PV.

       Example

         print DDisplay "abc\x{0a}de\x{20ac}fg";

         "abc\nde\x{20ac}fg"

       In void context, "DDisplay" uses "warn" to display the result.

   [1mDHexDump[0m
   [1mDHexDump ($var)[0m
   [1mDHexDump ($var, $length)[0m
       Show the (stringified) content of a scalar as a hex-dump.  If $var is
       omitted, $_ is dumped. Returns "undef" or an empty list if $var (or $_)
       is undefined. If $length is given and is lower than the length of the
       stringified $var, only <$length> bytes are dumped.

       In void context, the dump is done to STDERR. In scalar context, the
       complete dump is returned as a single string. In list context, the dump
       is returned as lines.

       Example

         print DHexDump "abc\x{0a}de\x{20ac}fg";

         0000  61 62 63 0a 64 65 e2 82  ac 66 67                 abc.de...fg

   [1mmy ($pv, $iv, $nv, $rv, $hm) = DDual ($var [, $getmagic])[0m
       DDual will return the basic elements in a variable, guaranteeing that
       no conversion takes place. This is very useful for dual-var variables,
       or when checking is a variable has defined entries for a certain type
       of scalar. For each String (PV), Integer (IV), Double (NV), and
       Reference (RV), the current value of $var is returned or undef if it is
       not set (yet).  The 5th element is an indicator if $var has magic,
       which is [1mnot [22minvoked in the returned values, unless explicitly asked
       for with a true optional second argument.

       Example

         print DPeek for DDual ($!, 1);

       In void context, DDual does the equivalent of

         { my @d = DDual ($!, 1);
           print STDERR
             DPeek ($!), "\n",
             "  PV: ", DPeek ($d[0]), "\n",
             "  IV: ", DPeek ($d[1]), "\n",
             "  NV: ", DPeek ($d[2]), "\n",
             "  RV: ", DPeek ($d[3]), "\n";
           }

   [1mmy $len = DGrow ($pv, $size)[0m
       Fastest way to preallocate space for a PV scalar. Returns the allocated
       length. If $size is smaller than the already allocated space, it will
       not shrink.

   [1mmy $tp = triplevar ($pv, $iv, $nv)[0m
       When making "DDual" I wondered if it were possible to create triple-val
       scalar variables. Scalar::Util already gives us "dualvar", that creates
       you a scalar with different numeric and string values that return
       different values in different context. Not that "triplevar" would be
       very useful, compared to "dualvar", but at least this shows that it is
       possible.

       "triplevar" is not exported by default.

       Example:

         DDual Data::Peek::triplevar ("\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER PI}", 3, 3.1415);

         PVNV("\317\200"\0) [UTF8 "\x{3c0}"]
           PV: PV("\317\200"\0) [UTF8 "\x{3c0}"]
           IV: IV(3)
           NV: NV(3.1415)
           RV: SV_UNDEF

   [1mDDump ([$var [, $dig_level]])[0m
       A very useful module when debugging is "Devel::Peek", but is has one
       big disadvantage: it only prints to STDERR, which is not very handy
       when your code wants to inspect variables at a low level.

       Perl itself has "sv_dump", which does something similar, but still
       prints to STDERR, and only one level deep.

       "DDump" is an attempt to make the innards available to the script level
       with a reasonable level of compatibility. "DDump" is context sensitive.

       In void context, it behaves exactly like "Perl_sv_dump".

       In scalar context, it returns what "Perl_sv_dump" would have printed.

       The default for the first argument is $_.

       In list context, it returns a hash of the variable's properties. In
       this mode you can pass an optional second argument that determines the
       depth of digging.

       Example

         print scalar DDump "abc\x{0a}de\x{20ac}fg"

         SV = PV(0x723250) at 0x8432b0

           LEN = 16

       "DDump" uses an XS wrapper around "Perl_sv_dump" where the STDERR is
       temporarily caught to a pipe. The internal XS helper functions are not
       meant for user space

   [1mDDump_XS (SV *sv)[0m
       Base interface to internals for "DDump".

       Windows and AIX might be using a build where not all symbols that were
       supposed to be exported in the public API are not. "Perl_pv_peek" is
       one of them.

       Not all types of references are supported.

       No idea how far back this goes in perl support, but Devel::PPPort has
       proven to be a big help.
