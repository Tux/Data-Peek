Module:
    DDumper

Description:
    Modified and extended wrapper functions to make debugging more
    pleasureable.

    DDumper is a wrapper around Data::Dumper with always sorted keys.
    The output is however reflowed and not parseable anymore (in most
    cases) as the quotation around the keys is removed.

    DDump is a wrapper around perl's core function sv_dump (), which
    should enable you to use the output instead of the default behaviour
    that only prints to STDERR.

    DPeek is a wrapper around internals Perl_sv_peek
